            <h4>Simon Says Game</h4>
            <p>I developed an interactive and responsive "Simon Says" game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to engage users with its dynamic gameplay and adaptive features. The game challenges players by generating a random sequence of colors or sounds that they must replicate, increasing the sequence length with each successful round to test memory skills. It includes a scoring system that tracks the player's performance, awarding points for correct inputs and storing the highest score using localStorage, encouraging replayability as users strive to beat their records. The design is fully responsive, ensuring seamless functionality across devices by using media queries to adapt layouts, button sizes, and interactions for both desktop and mobile users. Additionally, it supports both touch and click events, making it accessible and intuitive for all types of players.</p>
